### Final project contribution

#### Liangqi Tang



In this final project, Nawat and I equally shared the work. I'm responsible for Introduction, EDA, ARMA, global search and profile likelihood as well as some revisions of the whole project. Nawat is responsible for SEIR model, local search and combine and rivise the whole project. Yuanjie are supposed to do global search and profile likelihood but he seldom made discussion and response and told us that he met difficulties until the last 2 days before the deadline, which put heavy time pressure our project. Until the last minute he submitted a bad results as global search based on local search. Also It took a week before he replied our email to discuss our final project and he made little contribution in the project.
